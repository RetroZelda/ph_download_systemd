make sure you have inotify-tools installed:
    sudo apt install inotify-tools

Install by running:
    sudo ./install.sh

Uninstall by running:
    sudo ./uninstall.sh

Installing will create a systemd service called ph_download.service
It will also create a ./input folder.  

The service will be run as the user who called ./install.sh

Usage:
    make a new file inside of ./input that has a single porhub or vrporn url in each line.
    The service should pick it up and place each download inside of an ./output folder 
    When all videos are downloaded, that source file will be removed

    If you want to change the output folder, just modify the `folder_to_save` variable inside of ./scripts/monitor.sh

VRPorn:
    VRPorn requires an account to download.  You can specify your account's username and password inside 
    ./config/vrp_credentials as a json key/value pair for both the username and password

Webserver:
    There is a super basic and unsecure web server that runs on port 8008 that you
    can go to in order to easily add urls to be grabbed.  This is unsecure and really 
    basic, so i wouldnt expose this outside of your network so if you use nginx or 
    another reverse proxy, i would recomend to make sure it can only be accessed internally


Special Thanks:
    Special thanks to https://github.com/Egsagon/PHUB.git for doing the hard work for me
