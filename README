make sure you have inotify-tools installed:
    sudo apt install inotify-tools

Install by running:
    sudo ./install.sh

Uninstall by running:
    sudo ./uninstall.sh

Installing will create a systemd service called ph_download.service
It will also create a ./input folder.  

The service will be run as the user who called ./install.sh

Usage:
    make a new file inside of ./input that has a single porhub url in each line.
    The service should pick it up and place each download inside of an ./output folder 
    When all videos are downloaded, that source file will be removed

    If you want to change the output folder, just modify the `folder_to_save` variable inside of ./scripts/monitor.sh
